# 🧠 Logical Challenges Practice

A growing collection of **algorithmic & logical coding challenges** used for daily practice and pattern mastery.

The goal of this repository is **not memorization**, but to:

* Understand problem patterns
* Write clean and efficient solutions
* Build strong algorithmic intuition

More challenges will be added progressively.

---

## 🚀 Focus Areas

* Sliding Window
* Frequency Counting
* Interval Problems
* Pointer Techniques
* Edge Case Reasoning
* Time & Space Complexity Awareness

All solutions aim for **clarity first**, then efficiency.

## 📌 Current Challenges

### 1️⃣ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Problem**
Given a string, return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example**

```js
input:  "abcabcbb"
output: 3
```

**Key Concepts**

* Sliding window
* Set usage
* Two pointers
* O(n) time complexity

---

### 2️⃣ First Non-Repeating Character Index

**Problem**
Given a string, return the index of the first character that appears only once. Return `-1` if none exists.

**Example**

```js
input:  "aabbccdeff"
output: 6  // 'd'
```

**Key Concepts**

* Frequency counting
* Hash maps / objects
* Two-pass strategy
* O(n) time complexity

---

### 3️⃣ Interval Overlap Detection

**Problem**
Determine whether **any intervals overlap**.

**Example**

```js
input:  [[1,4], [5,6], [4,6]]
output: true
```

**Key Concepts**

* Interval sorting
* Adjacent comparison
* Early exit
* O(n log n) time complexity

---

### 4️⃣ Can Intervals Be Non-Overlapping?

**Problem**
Determine whether **all intervals can exist without overlapping**. Touching endpoints are allowed.

**Example**

```js
input:  [[1,2], [3,4], [2,3]]
output: true
```

**Key Concepts**

* Same interval pattern, inverted logic
* Sorting + scan
* Logical condition reversal
* O(n log n) time complexity

---

## 🧩 Philosophy

* Problems are solved **step by step**, not rushed
* Understanding *why* a solution works matters more than the solution itself
* Mistakes are part of the learning process

> "If you can explain it simply, you truly understand it."

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Language: **JavaScript**
* Environment: Any modern JS runtime (Node.js / Browser)

---

## 🌱 Roadmap (Upcoming)

* Longest Increasing Subarray
* Merge Intervals
* Two Sum Variants
* Sliding Window with Constraints
* Prefix Sums
* More interval & pointer-based challenges

---

Happy coding 💙
This repository grows with every challenge solved.
